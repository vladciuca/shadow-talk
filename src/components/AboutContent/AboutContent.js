      We are always evolving into different versions of ourselves, and right now
      the version you are can be very different from the version of yourself you
      were a year or even a month ago.

    <Paragraph>
      No matter how much positive action we take towards reaching the highest
      version of ourselves that we can imagine, we will always find ways to

      This could be a pain from a past relationship, a feeling of unworthiness,
      a need for validation from others or a lack of confidence in some aspects
      of your life.
