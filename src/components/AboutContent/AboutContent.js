    <Paragraph>
      We are always evolving into different versions of ourselves, and right now
      the version you are can be very different from the version of yourself you
      were a year or even a month ago.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      No matter how much positive action we take towards reaching the highest
      version of ourselves that we can imagine, we will always find ways to
      "self-sabotage" if we suppress negative past experiences, getting dragged
      down to the lowest version of ourselves that we can accept.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      By not addressing these issues we end up unconsciously carrying them
      around with us.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      These can translate into negative actions and unwanted behaviors that we
      feel we have no control over.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Behind every negative action there is a positive intent - an instinct to
      protect ourselves from reliving negative experiences that impacted us in
      some way.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Chatting with your <strong>Past-Self</strong> to identify and acknowledge
      the positive intent behind these negative actions in order to reframe it
      to your <strong>Present-Self</strong> is the way to heal and move forward.
    </Paragraph>

    <Title>STEP ONE</Title>
    <SubTitle>
      Choose a topic that you feel is currently holding you back.
    </SubTitle>
    <SubText>
      <div>
        This could range from a pain from a past relationship, a feeling of
        unworthiness, a need for validation from others, a lack of confidence in
        some aspects of your life or anything else that you feel is affecting
        you in a negative way.
      </div>
    </SubText>
    <Title>STEP TWO</Title>
    <SubTitle>
      Start a chat about that topic with your <strong>Past-Self</strong>.
    </SubTitle>
    <SubText>
      Be mindful and have questions like:
      <ul>
        <li>Why are you doing this?</li>
        <li>What do you want from me?</li>
        <li>What are you trying to protect me from?</li>
      </ul>
      There is no real script to it and you are going to be surprised how much
      can come up.
    </SubText>
    <Title>STEP THREE</Title>
    <SubTitle>Listen to it fully and honor that part of you.</SubTitle>
    <SubText>
      <div>
        Don't judge your <strong>Past-Self</strong>, don't try to explain it
        rationally - “you are wrong, you are weak” - that can amplify the guilt
        around a past experience.
      </div>
      <div>Just hear it out, acknowledge and accept it.</div>
    </SubText>
    <Title>STEP FOUR</Title>
    <SubTitle>
      Integrate it with your <strong>Present-Self</strong>
    </SubTitle>
    <SubText>
      <div>
        Imagine yourself in your present state going back to that event, to the
        thing that you want to resolve and resolving it, seeing it go the way
        you want. Give yourself all the resources and knowledge that you have
        now. Be the friend you needed and didn't have in that moment.
      </div>
      <div>Show compassion, support and forgiveness to yourself.</div>
    </SubText>
  </>
